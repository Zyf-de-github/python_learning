This is the repository related to my learning of python language It contains all the items I wrote

- a "canteen ordering system" based on pyqt
    The system includes a shopping cart, food 
  classification, settlement, payment, etc.

- a "MineSweeper" based on pyqt:
    The game includes difficulty selection, leaderboards, 
  time record, automatic recursive minesweeper, and is a 
  replica of the minesweeper function that comes with Windows.
